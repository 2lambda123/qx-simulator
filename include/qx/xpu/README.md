This directory contains remnants from Nader's XPU library. Only some basic
utilities are still used; the actual multithreading logic has been replaced
with OpenMP.

Note that XPU uses the GPL license, while QX uses Apache 2.0. This was
originally done by Nader himself, so I'm assuming he's okay with the Apache
2.0 terms... considering they're not on their own compatible with Apache 2.0.
