XPU is a light-weight parallel programming library for multicore architectures. It's mainly
designed to ease parallelism expression without sacrificing execution efficiency. XPU provide
a light weight programming interface which allow programmer to express and combine several types
of prallelism. Parallel constructions are composed from a set of tasks which are defined by the 
programmer. XPU allow programmer to reuse most of sequential code (when parallelizing an existing 
sequential program) since it enable him to define tasks from functions, class methods or lambda
expression whithout significant alteration.
