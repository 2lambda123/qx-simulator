# qxelerator: QX as a Quantum Accelerator

This package provides the necessary interface to use QX as an accelerator.

## API

`qxelerator` mainly provides the following 3 API calls:

	
	qx.set('basic.qasm')					# set the required qasm to be executed on qx
	qx.execute()							# execute
	qx.get_measurement_outcome(0)	        # get measurement results from qubit 'n' as bool
    get_state()                            # get quantum register state as string
	

## Required packages
At the moment only tested on Linux. Requirements are same as qx plus:
- cmake >= 2.8
- swig >= 3.0
- python development package >= 3.5

## Get qx-simulator

Clone qx-simulator:

    git clone git@github.com:QE-Lab/qx-simulator.git
    cd qx-simulator
    git checkout enh/qxelerator-update

Note: For now enh/qxelerator-update contains the update which supports cQASM v1.0 by using libqasm. Soon it will be merge to develop branch, which means after the merge, develop branch can also be used in the last step as:

    git checkout develop


Get the submodules:

    git submodule update --init --recursive

## setup

Compile dependence library (libqasm etc) by entering qx-simulator directory by:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make


In the root directory of qx-simulator, enter qxelarator.

then run:

    python3 setup.py install --user

## Usage
See `tests` directory for some simple examples. To run a test, for-example `test_basic.py`, execute

    python3 test_basic.py

## Clean
To clean temporary files generated by install, execute:

    python3 cleanme.py

# Instructions for setting up qxelerator on ce-qsim machines

These instructions should be followed on qsim01 machine.

swig 3.x is required which is not available on ce-qsim machines. We can compile it localy for us (without sudo rights) by following the instructions below.

## swig 3.x installation

Download swig to bulk from one of the followign links:

- https://github.com/swig/swig/archive/rel-3.0.12.tar.gz
- http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swig-3.0.12.tar.gz

for instance by:

    wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swig-3.0.12.tar.gz


extract:

    tar -xzf swig-3.0.12.tar.gz

    cd swig-3.0.12


To install swig in local drive in home directory (create if it is not already there), run:

    ./configure --prefix=/home/iashraf/local
    make
    make install

add /home/iashraf/local to your path

    export PATH=/home/iashraf/local/bin:$PATH

## Get qx-simulator

Clone qx-simulator:

    git clone git@github.com:QE-Lab/qx-simulator.git
    cd qx-simulator
    git checkout enh/qxelerator-update

Note: For now enh/qxelerator-update contains the update which supports cQASM v1.0 by using libqasm. Soon it will be merge to develop branch, which means after the merge, develop branch can also be used in the last step as:

    git checkout develop


Get the submodules:

    git submodule update --init --recursive


## Compilation of libqasm, flex/bison dependencies

Compile dependence library (libqasm etc) by entering qx-simulator directory by:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake3 ..
    make

## qxelerator installation

In the root directory of qx-simulator, enter qxelarator.

edit setup.py file to change cmake to cmake3

then run:

    python3 setup.py install --user

This will setup qxelerator. Enter tests directory to run a test by:

    python3 test_basic.py

That's all folks ...
